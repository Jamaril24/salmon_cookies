# salmon_cookies

team agreement 

We both are going to help eachother. But we did Jamari was going to do the sales js, and html and I did the html, and the styles. Our plan is to have it organized and looking nice. We are going to use the colors grey and salmon pink with maybe white font. 
Jamari and I ended up helping eachother with what we told ourselves what we were going to do. But we finshed and we think it looks nice and organized may not be the best but we tried our best. We ran into many problems with pushing but we ended up figuring everything out.
